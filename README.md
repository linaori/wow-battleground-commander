## Battleground Commander
Provides quality of life features for Battlegrounds. 

### Queue Tools
This adds a bunch of tools that will help group leaders get the info they need to queue or cancel whenever needed.

#### Automatic Role Selection
You can enable automatic role selection for battlegrounds to reduce a manual step that delays entry. You can find this
option above the role selection in the PvP window, or in the addon settings.

#### Queue Entry and Decline Tools
When a queue entry window shows, for non-group leaders the "Enter" button is disabled by default, and additionally
this button will be disabled if the group leader cancels. This behavior can be changed in the settings, and holding the
shift button will re-enable the button. When the group leader enters the battleground and has BGC, it will also enable
the enter button for non-group leaders.

The group leader has the ability to automatically do a ready check when a queue entry is cancelled and if not
all group members declined within a certain time limit.

#### Group Information
This window can be accessed through the PvP window by checking the "Group Info" box. This list shows all players in your
group and shows various bits of info used to queue. You can also do a ready check from here, and open the settings.
You'll be able to see the following information in the columns:
 - if that player has "Automatic Role Selection" enabled (BGC required by that player)
 - if that player has the Mercenary Contract buff, and how long remaining (BGC required by that player)
 - status column which shows various bits of info:
   - ready check status
   - role selection status
   - deserter debuff remaining
   - if the queue entry window showed up
   - if that player entered (BGC required by that player)
   - if that player declined entry (BGC required by that player)

#### Queue Pause Detection
Free choice of automatically notifying the group when the queue is paused, resumed, and doing a ready check to verify
who is and isn't ready. These options can also be limited to being a group leader or assist. Additionally, if someone
else with this addon does an automated ready check, it will try to automatically accept it.

### Battleground Tools
Extra conveniences for Battlegrounds.

#### Instructions Frame
This frame shows Raid Warnings from your raid leader with a time to indicate how long ago this message was sent. You can
configure this frame to load only in specific zones, and it will filter out duplicate messages.

#### Battleground Leader
Users with this addon can request lead from other users with this addon. The leader will receive the option to give lead
or reject the request, and remember the choice in the future.
