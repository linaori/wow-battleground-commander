## Battleground Commander
Provides quality of life features for Battlegrounds. 

### Queue Tools
This adds extra ready check tools, as well as being able to see who has a deserter debuff, or mercenary contract. As
the mercenary contract is invisible to other players, the players you want to see the contract for need to have this
addon installed.

#### Automatic Role Selection
You can enable automatic role selection for battlegrounds to reduce a manual step that delays entry.

#### Queue Pause Detection
Free choice of automatically notifying the group when the queue is paused, resumed, and doing a ready check to verify
who is and isn't ready. These options can also be limited to being a group leader or assist. Additionally, if someone
else with this addon does an automated ready check, it will try to automatically accept it.

#### Queue Entry and Decline Tools
The ability to automatically do a ready check when a queue entry is cancelled, and automated "Enter" or "Cancel"
messages when the group leader clicks either of those buttons.

### Battleground Tools
Extra conveniences for Battlegrounds.

#### Instructions Frame
This frame shows Raid Warnings from your raid leader with a time to indicate how long ago this message was sent. You can
configure this frame to load only in specific zones, and it will filter out duplicate messages.

#### Battleground Leader
Users with this addon can request lead from other users with this addon. The leader will receive the option to give lead
or reject the request, and remember the choice in the future.
